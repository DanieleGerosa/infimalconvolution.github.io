## Daniele Gerosa
I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Lund University, [Center for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.maths.lu.se/english/). My main supervisor is [Marcus Carlsson](http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklu/personal/mc/) (Lund University) and my co-supervisor is Rajmund Mokso (MAX IV Laboratory). I am studying Convex Analysis applied to compressed sensing and optimization problems, specifically to the phase retrieval problem.

I am also interested in Real and Functional Analysis.

### Short CV
- **September 2017 - ongoing.** PhD in Mathematics at Lund University (Sweden), Center for Mathematical Sciences.

   As part of departmental duties I work as teaching assistant in several courses. So far I led more than 100 hours of exercises sessions (Linear Algebra II, Analysis in Several Variables I & II).

- **September 2015 - July 2017.** MSc in Mathematics at [Padova University](http://www.math.unipd.it/en/) (Italy). 
   
   Thesis advisor: prof. [Roberto Monti](http://www.math.unipd.it/~monti/).
   
   Thesis title: *Trace theorem for the Martinet distribution*.
- **August 2015 - December 2015.** Exchange student at [Bergen University](https://www.uib.no/en/math) (Norway).

- **September 2011 - July 2015.** BSc in Mathematics at Padova University (Italy).

   Thesis advisor: prof. Roberto Monti.
   
   Thesis title: *Gromov-Hausdorff metric and existence of geodesics*.
   
I have been an inner student of [Collegio Universitario don Nicola Mazza](https://www.collegiomazza.it/) for the whole period of my italian academic studies.
