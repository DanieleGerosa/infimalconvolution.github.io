## Daniele Gerosa
I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Lund University, [Center for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.maths.lu.se/english/). My main supervisor is [Marcus Carlsson](http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklu/personal/mc/) (Lund University) and my co-supervisor is [Rajmund Mokso](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lucat/user/d36645bc16f71bc54758956dc51d715d) (MAX IV Laboratory). I am studying Convex Analysis and Matrix Theory applied to compressed sensing and optimization problems, with a specific interest into the phase retrieval problem arising in Coherent Diffractive Imaging.

I am also interested in Real and Functional Analysis.

### Short CV
- **September 2017 - ongoing.** PhD in Mathematics at Lund University (Sweden), Center for Mathematical Sciences.

   As part of departmental duties I work as teaching assistant in several courses. So far I led more than 200 hours of exercises sessions (Analysis in One Variable, Linear Algebra II, Analysis in Several Variables I & II). Grading of exams and mid-term assigments is part of teaching duties too.
   
   In Sweden doctoral education consists also in a certain number of courses to be attended. I have attended and passed the following: specialized course in Distributions Theory (classical Pseudo-Differential Operators theory, Paradifferential Calculus), Convex Analysis, X-Ray Optics, Introduction to Deep Learning, specialized course in Linear Functional Analysis, Nonparametric Inference and Teaching and Learning in Higher Education.

- **September 2015 - July 2017.** MSc in Mathematics at [Padova University](http://www.math.unipd.it/en/) (Italy). 
   
   Thesis advisor: prof. [Roberto Monti](http://www.math.unipd.it/~monti/).
   
   Thesis title: *Trace theorem for the Martinet distribution*.
- **August 2015 - December 2015.** Exchange student at [Bergen University](https://www.uib.no/en/math) (Norway).

- **September 2011 - July 2015.** BSc in Mathematics at Padova University (Italy).

   Thesis advisor: prof. Roberto Monti.
   
   Thesis title: *Gromov-Hausdorff metric and existence of geodesics*.
   
I have been an inner student of [Collegio Universitario don Nicola Mazza](https://www.collegiomazza.it/) for the whole period of my italian academic studies.

### Stuff I wrote
- [My Bachelor thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mcv4d39av3wiaxk/bozza_tesi.pdf?dl=0) (in italian). 
- [My Master thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1pzb181nov0qfu/bozza_tesiM.pdf?dl=0). A paper with an extension of the result proved here has been recently submitted.
- [Abstract](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ysn6tiu411su46k/abstract_Gerosa.pdf?dl=0) and [notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ww0m8pm7vtzwerp/seminario_Gerosa.pdf?dl=0) on the surjectivity of the trace operator that I have written for a seminar.
- [Notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ii4mqsjtthglzqo/Garding_ineq.pdf?dl=0) on the sharp Gårding inequality. The proof is, more or less verbatim, the one in Lars Hörmander's *Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators*. I added some comments and expanded some "obscure" steps.   
- [Topics in General Topology](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t947ku67km0at1e/top_exam.pdf?dl=0). A selection for a presentation.
