## Daniele Gerosa
I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Lund University, [Center for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.maths.lu.se/english/). My main supervisor is [Marcus Carlsson](http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklu/personal/mc/) (Lund University) and my co-supervisor is Rajmund Mokso (MAX IV Laboratory). I am studying Convex Analysis applied to Optimization problems, specifically to the phase retrieval problem.

I am also interested in Real and Functional Analysis.
