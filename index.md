## Daniele Gerosa
I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Lund University, [Center for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.maths.lu.se/english/) (where, among other beautiful minds, [Lars Hörmander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_H%C3%B6rmander), [Lars Gårding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_G%C3%A5rding) and [Marcel Riesz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Riesz) spent most of their worklives). I am supervised by [Marcus Carlsson](http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklu/personal/mc/) (Lund University). My research is focused on some aspects of compressed sensing, non-convex optimization and low-rank matrix recovery. I recently developed an interest in random matrix theory.

I also enjoy solving hard and challenging problems in Real and Functional Analysis.

### Short CV
- **September 2017 - April 2022.** PhD in Mathematics at Lunds Universitet (Sweden), Centre for Mathematical Sciences.

   As part of departmental duties I work as teaching assistant in several courses. So far I led more than 450 hours of exercises sessions (Analysis in One Variable, Linear Algebra II, Analysis in Several Variables I & II). Grading of exams and mid-term assignments is part of teaching duties too.
   
   In Sweden doctoral education consists also in a certain number of advanced courses to be attended (60 ECTS at least). I have so far attended the following: specialized course in Distributions Theory (classical Pseudo-Differential Operators theory, Paradifferential Calculus), specialized course in Linear Functional Analysis, advanced course in Calculus of Variations, Convex Analysis, X-Ray Optics, Introduction to Deep Learning, Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Nonparametric Inference, Teaching and Learning in Higher Education.

- **September 2015 - July 2017.** MSc in Mathematics at [Università degli Studi di Padova](http://www.math.unipd.it/en/) (Italy). 
   
   Thesis advisor: prof. [Roberto Monti](http://www.math.unipd.it/~monti/).
   
   Thesis title: *Trace theorem for the Martinet distribution*.
- **August 2015 - December 2015.** Exchange student at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/math) (Norway).

- **September 2011 - July 2015.** BSc in Mathematics at Università degli Studi di Padova (Italy).

   Thesis advisor: prof. Roberto Monti.
   
   Thesis title: *Gromov-Hausdorff metric and existence of geodesics*.
   
I have been a student of [Collegio Universitario don Nicola Mazza](https://www.collegiomazza.it/en/) for the entire period of my Italian academic education.
